# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸŽ‰ This is a React app built with Vite, designed to showcase a bit of what I doâ€”whether it's coding, creating art, gaming, or just having fun. Feel free to click around and explore!

## Libraries used

To give this portfolio a retro Windows 95 vibe, I used the awesome [React95](https://github.com/React95/React95) library. It's all about that nostalgia, right?
