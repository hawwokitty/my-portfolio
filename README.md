# My Portfolio

This is a React app made with Vite for my portfolio :D It showcases some of what I do (coding, art, gaming, etc), feel free to click around!

## Libraries used

This portfolio is made to look like a Windows 95 desktop, so it uses [this](https://github.com/React95/React95) library to achieve the look.
